# 🌍 Satellite Image Analysis

This project explores Earth observation data using Python and machine learning.
It focuses on analyzing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with the goal of detecting
land usage patterns, NDVI analysis, and more.

##📌 Problem Statement:
“Automated Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification over the UK using Satellite Imagery”
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning pipeline capable of classifying land into various categories (e.g., urban, agricultural, forest, water, barren, 
etc.) using multispectral satellite images. This can support applications in urban planning, agriculture monitoring, deforestation tracking, and climate policy assessments.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Rasterio, EarthPy, GDAL
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- JupyterLab

## 📂 Structure
- `data/`: Raw satellite images
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory and visual analysis
- `src/`: Reusable Python functions
- `outputs/`: Results and figures

## 📌 Goal
Build a complete Earth observation analysis pipeline and explore real-world applications
in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urbanization.
