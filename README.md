# 🌍 Satellite Image Analysis

This project explores Earth observation data using Python and machine learning.
It focuses on analyzing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with the goal of detecting
land usage patterns, NDVI analysis, and more.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Rasterio, EarthPy, GDAL
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- JupyterLab

## 📂 Structure
- `data/`: Raw satellite images
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory and visual analysis
- `src/`: Reusable Python functions
- `outputs/`: Results and figures

## 📌 Goal
Build a complete Earth observation analysis pipeline and explore real-world applications
in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urbanization.
